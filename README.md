# Movie Recommendation System Backend

## Overview
This project is a backend system for a movie recommendation system, built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It is designed with a modular architecture, including middleware, controllers, models, and routes, to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Features
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing users, movies, and recommendations.
- **Middleware**: Implements functionalities like error handling, logging, and authentication.
- **Database Integration**: Supports interaction with a database through well-structured models.
- **Testing**: Includes tests to ensure the reliability of API endpoints.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized folders for configuration, services, and utilities.
